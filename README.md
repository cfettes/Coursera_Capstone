### The Battle of the Neighbourhoods project involved utilising location data through Foursquare API, in addition to other datasets, specifically on wards within Greater London. Data on a number of variables - crime rate, educational quality, percentage area that is open space, public transport accessibility, property type, property price, and type of area (determined through the most common venues within each ward - were used to generate location recommendations for a case study looking to purchase a property within Greater London. 

### By changing the property buyer preferences and weights of features considered, this project can be applied to any buyer seeking to purchase within London, but unsure of which areas within London are best suited to them.
